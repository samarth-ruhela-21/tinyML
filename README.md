This project demonstrates how to run a Machine Learning image classification model on an Arm Cortex-M7 microcontroller (STM32H747I Discovery Board) using TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers (TinyML).

The system performs CIFAR-10 image classification directly on the microcontroller without requiring cloud or internet connectivity.

This proves that AI can run on ultra-low power embedded systems.
